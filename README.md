## Why Python?
- Python is free, and open-source
- Other people use it (most questions can be googled)
- It does a number of different things well (works with CSVs, matrices, strings, etc.)
- It tends to be easy to read, and generally follows the rules of a "good" language.
- It works well with other tools (easily load xlsx, csv, .nii, fasta, etc.)
- There are a number of useful packages (Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Scikit-image, etc.)

### [content example]
- A little bit of python
- A little bit on how to organize projects to facilitate reproducible science
- How to make things that are way fancier than your programming skill level, using python packages

## Resources to Learn More
I find it super helpful to watch youtube tutorials online. There are a bunch. [PyCon2019](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxs2IIVXaEHHA4BtTiWZ2mQ/videos) is a good place to start.
